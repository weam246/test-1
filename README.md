# Mood Classifier 😊☹️

A simple image classification project to detect whether a person looks **Happy** or **Sad** using Teachable Machine and Google Colab.

## 🧠 Project Idea

A custom image classification model was trained using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) with two classes:
- Happy 😀
- Sad 😢

The trained model was exported as a `.h5` file and used in a Google Colab notebook to make predictions on images.
